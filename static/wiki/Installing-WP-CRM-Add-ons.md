### Updating your product

Once you have activated your product, you’ll be able to update your product via the **Dashboard > Updates** admin screen.

To update your product:

1.  Go to **Dashboard > Updates**
2.  **Select** your product under Plugins/Themes
3.  Click the **update** button

When updating plugins and themes, your files **will be overwritten**. We recommend [backing up your files](http://codex.wordpress.org/Backing_Up_Your_WordPress_Files), and using [child themes](http://codex.wordpress.org/Child_Themes) for modifications.

### Terms of use 

Products do not have the limit of usage. License gives you ability to update add-on or theme** within one year after purchase.** You will still have ability to use product after one year expired, but updates won’t be available any more. To receive updates after one year expired you will need to repurchase product. (We are providing discounts for renewal the licenses )

For users who upgraded products from old version updates will be available till  3 August 2016. 

Old licenses management will be available for old versions of plugins or themes.

**Please note** that if you deactivate your license after expired period, you won’t have ability to activate it again.

### Customization

Please also note that we do not support our products if the code was customized directly. After update **you will lose your plugin customization**. If you need to customize some template in our plugin,</span> you will need to copy  template to the root theme folder and only there customize it.

### Moving licenses

Each add-on you can use on two sites. So if you need to test between staging and production it’s simple. You can also easily move licenses from site to site. To deactivate your license key and reactivate it for another site please go to your Account Dashboard > [UD Account](https://usabilitydynamics.com/account) page.

From here you can ‘deactivate’ your license key:

Then you can reactivate the same license by going to your other WordPress site’s Dashboard where it says WP-Property Licenses, and copy and paste your license and hit enter. Follow the steps above for Adding Licenses if needed.
