### Automation

Use other attribute as components. Example: **[last_name], [rank]** will become **Smith, Sgt.**

### Notifications and Trigger Actions

Notification messages can be fired off when certain events, such as contact form submission, are executed. Multiple notification events can be attached to a single **trigger action**. Multiple tags, such as **[user_email]** and **[display_name]**, are available to be used as dynamically replaceable tags when setting up notifications.

Which tags are available depend on the trigger event, but in most cases all user data slugs can be used. On a shortcode form message, **[message_content]**, **[profile_link]** and **[trigger_action]** variables are also available.
