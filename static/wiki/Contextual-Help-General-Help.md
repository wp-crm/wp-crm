### Roles - Hidden Attributes

If certain user attributes are not applicable to certain roles, such as "Client Type" to the "Administrator" role, you can elect to hide the unapplicable attributes on profile editing pages.

### Predefined Values

If you want your attributes to have predefined values, such as in a dropdown, or a checkbox list, enter a comma separated list of values you want to use. You can also get more advanced by using taxonomies - to load all values from a taxonomy, simply type line: **taxonomy:taxonomy_name**.
