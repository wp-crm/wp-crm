For the purchased features, you will see the same interface, with the difference that every feature will give you the option to disable it completely, as seen on the screenshot below:

For every non-purchased  Premium Feature entry that appears on this tab you see a description of the feature and a link to purchase it. If you use the [purchase feature] links, your domain will automatically be sent and you will not have to fill it in on the purchase process.
